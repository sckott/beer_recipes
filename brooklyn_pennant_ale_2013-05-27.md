# Brooklyn Pennant Ale  pale ale

This is a clone of Dogfish Head's 60 minute IPA from the book [CloneBrews: Homebrew Recipes for 150 Commercial Beers][book]. 

Ingredients:

+ 9.5 lbs British 2-row pale malt (get 11 lbs instead as Dan's grinder is apparently bad)
+ 9 oz British crystal malt (get 12 oz)
+ 6 oz Belgian aromatic malt (get 9 oz)
+ Hops
	+ 1.5 oz. Fuggles
	+ 1 oz. Willamette
	+ 1/3 oz. Perle
	+ 1/3 oz. Hallertau
	+ 1/3 oz. Cascade
+ 1 tsp. Irish moss 
+ Wyeast 1968 London ESB Ale yeast (2nd choice: Wyeast 1028 London Ale yeast)
+ 1.25 cups Muntons extra-light DME

Steps:

1. I'm doing whole grain, so I use a mash tun. Warmed up water in pot on stove to 154 degrees F. Then poured the whole three malts together into the cooler, and poured enough water on top of the malts to cover them.  I stirred occasionally and measured temperature. If it was too cold I put in some hot water.  After 90 min., vorlofted a bit, sparged with hotter water (160 deg F) a few times, and added back to pot. 
2. Brought volume in pot up to about 5 gallons. Bring to boil.
3. Add 
	+ 1 oz. Fuggles hops (for bittering)
	+ 1 oz. Willamette hops (for bittering)
4. Boil for 45 min
5. Add
	+ 1/3 oz. Perle hops (for flavor)
	+ 1/3 oz. Hallertau hops (for flavor)
	+ 1 tbsp irish moss
	+ (put in the copper tubing apparatus to sterilize for the last 15 min. of boil)
6. Boil for 14 minutes
7. Add
	+ 1/2 oz. Fuggles hops (for aroma) 
	+ 1/10 oz. Centennial hops (for aroma) (didn't have cascades)
	+ 1/10 oz. Simcoe hops (for aroma) (didn't have cascades)
8. Boil for 1 minute
9. Remove pot from stove and cool down as fast as possible to temperature ideal for the yeast - I used the copper tubing I put in the boil earlier.
10. Transfer cooled down wort to primary fermenter
11. Put in yeast when temperature is right (Wyeast 1968 London ESB Ale yeast, pitch yeast at 68-72 degrees F)
12. Took gravity reading right after pitching yeast. It was at 1.055 (matched the target, woohoo!). 
12. Primary fermentation started on 2013-05-29, fermented at ~70 deg F, ended 2013-06-05
13. Secondary fermentation started on 2013-06-05, ended on 2013-06-12
14. Final gravity reading before bottling was XXX
