This is a clone of [Chicken Killer Barley Wine ale](http://www.santafebrewing.com/our_beer/detail/23) from the book [CloneBrews: Homebrew Recipes for 150 Commercial Beers][book].

This is `v0.1` of this clone.

### Ingredients

##### Grains

+ 16.5 lbs American 2-row pale malt (called for 15.25 lbs)
+ 9 oz British dark crystal malt - suggested by brewshop folks (called for 120L American crystal malt)
+ 4 oz 40L American crystal malt
+ 4 oz Belgian Cara-Munich malt
+ 4 oz melanoidin malt

##### Hop bill

+ 2.1 oz. Chinook
+ 1.25 oz. US Hallertau (called for German H.)
+ 1.25 oz. Crystal

##### Yeast

+ [Imperial Yeast - `A07 Flagship`](http://www.imperialyeast.com/yeast-strains/) (recipe had Wyeast 1056)

##### Boil

+ 3 hrs

##### Other ingredients

+ 1.5 lbs Belgian clear candi sugar
+ 1 tsp. Irish moss
+ 1.25 cups Muntons extra-light DME

### Steps:

1. I'm doing all grain, so I use a mash tun. Warmed up water in pot on stove to 151 degrees F. Then poured the whole three malts together into the cooler, and poured enough water on top of the malts to cover them.  I stirred occasionally and measured temperature. If it was too cold I put in some hot water.  After 90 min., vorlofted ~ 10 minutes, fly sparged with hotter water (170ish deg F), and added back to pot, ended up with about 6.5 gallons.
2. Bring to boil. Boil for 1.5 hrs.
3. Add
	+ 2 oz. Chinook hops (bittering)
    + 1.5 lbs Belgian clear candi sugar
4. Boil for 1 hr 15 min
5. Add
	+ 1 oz. US Hallertau (flavor)
	+ 1/4 oz. Crystal (flavor)
	+ 1 tbsp irish moss
	+ (put in the copper tubing to sterilize for the last 15 min. of boil)
6. Boil for 14 minutes
7. Add aroma hops
	+ 1 oz. Crystal (aroma)
8. Boil for 1 minute
9. Remove pot from stove and cool down as fast as possible to temperature ideal for the yeast - I used the copper tubing I put in the boil earlier.
10. Measure initial gravity at this point
11. Transfer cooled down wort to primary fermenter (bucket)
12. Pitched yeast at ~68 degrees F
13. On 2016-01-16 moved to secondary fermenter (glass carboy) and added
    + 0.4 oz Crystal hop pellets
    + 0.4 oz US Hallertau hop pellets
14. On 2016-01-17 added more yeast...
15. On 2016-01-19 bottled
