This is a clone of Lagunitas IPA from the book [CloneBrews: Homebrew Recipes for 200 Commercial Beers][book].

### Ingredients

##### Grains

+ 10 lbs American 2-Row pale malt (original called for 9.25, I upped a bitto account for probably lower efficiency of extraction process I have)
+ 12 oz. German Dark Munich malt 
+ 8 oz. 10oL American crystal malt
+ 4 oz. 40oL American crystal malt

##### Hop bill

+ 1 oz Magnum (recipe had Horizon) (recipe said to do 29% less than 1 oz for all grain, but I like the hops)
+ 0.5 oz Willamette
+ 1.4 oz Cascade
+ 0.6 oz Centennial

### Steps:

1. Warmed up water in pot on stove to 151 degrees F. Then poured all malt in together into the cooler, and poured enough water on top of the malts to cover them.  I stirred occasionally and measured temperature. If it was too cold I put in some hot water.  After 90 min., vorlofted 3 times, sparged with hotter water (165 deg F) twice (each time resting for about 10 min.), and added back to pot each time. 
2. Brought volume in pot up to about 5.2 gallons. 
3. Add 
    + 1 oz. Horizon hops 
4. Boil for 45 min.
5. Add 
    + 0.5 oz. Willamette hops
    + 0.5 oz. Cascade hops
    + 1 tsp. Irish moss
6. Boil for 10 min.
8. Add
    + 1/3 oz. Centennial hops
    + 2/3 oz. Cascade hops
9. Boil for 4 minutes
10. Add
    + 0.25 oz. Centennial hops
    + 0.25 oz. Cascade hops
11. Boil for 1 min.
12. Remove pot from stove and cool down as fast as possible to temperature ideal for the yeast - I used the copper tubing I put in the boil earlier.
13. (Add any water to bring back up to 5 gallons)
14. Transfer cooled down wort to primary fermenter
15. Put in yeast when temperature is right (Wyeast 1056 - American Ale Yeast, pitch yeast at 69 degrees F).
16. At start of secondary fermentation after primary (7 days later), add
    + 0.5 oz. Cascade hops
    + 0.25 oz. Centennial hops
17. Just before bottling, boiled 1.25 c. DME, added to mix, and then bottled. 

> Note: At 15 left to go put in the copper tubing apparatus to sterilize for the last 15 min. of boil (optional if you have one)
