__POST BREWING NOTES:__ Crap, so i screwed the ABV up on this one. Not sure what went wrong - maybe didn't grind up grains sufficiently at the brew shop, or didn't mash long enough. Hmmmm...It was probably the fact that there was 3lbs crystal in the original recipe (link below), and brew shop suggested that was too much, so went down to 1.5 lbs. Should have upped the main grain by 1.5 lbs or more. So should be ~11 lb 2-row pale malt next time. 

Modified from the recipe [http://therootcellarsgarden.com/2011/11/12/the-3-points-nw-oatmeal-pale-ale-extract/](http://therootcellarsgarden.com/2011/11/12/the-3-points-nw-oatmeal-pale-ale-extract/)

I'm modifying this slightly from the original recipe. The target was to get a clone of Burnside Brewing's Oatmeal Pale Ale...we'll see how it goes. 

### Ingredients:

* 9.5 lb 2-row pale ale malt grain (original recipe used 7 lbs Pilsner light malt liquid extract, thought about using Pilser malt grain, but I like ale malt grain more, so...yeah)
* 1.5 lb Crystal 15L (original recipe used 3 lbs)
* 1 lb Golden Naked Oats (original recipe used rolled oats)
* 1 tsp Irish Moss
* 2 oz Centennial
* 2 oz Saaz (original recipe used Cascade)
* 2 oz Mt. Hood
* Wyeast 1056 American Ale

### Steps:

1. Toast oats at 300 for 15 minutes in oven. Let cool.
2. Did all grain in a mashtun (see below). Warmed up water in pot on stove to 165 degrees F. Steeped grains, Crystal, and oats in ~ 4 gallons of water. Stirred occasionally, measured temperature; if too cold I put in some hot water.  After 80 min., vorlofted a bit, sparged with hotter water (160 deg F) a few times, and added back to pot.
3. Brought volume in pot up to about 5 gallons. Bring to boil.
4. Add 
    + 2 oz. Centennial hops (for bittering)
4. Boil for 30 min
5. Add 
    + 1 oz. Cascade hops (flavor)
6. Boil for 15 min
5. Add
    + 1 oz. Cascade hops (flavor)
    + 1 tbsp irish moss
    + (put in the copper tubing apparatus to sterilize for the last 15 min. of boil)
6. Boil for 14 minutes
7. Add aroma hops
    + 1 oz. Mt. Hood hops (aroma)
8. Boil for 1 minute 
    + Measure initial gravity at this point
9. Remove pot from stove and cool down as fast as possible to temperature ideal for the yeast - I used the copper tubing I put in the boil earlier.
10. Transfer cooled down wort to primary fermenter (carboy)
11. Put in yeast when temperature is right (yeast, pitched yeast at 68-72 degrees F)
12. On 2015-01-17 moved to secondary fermenter (bucket)
    + Dry hop with 1 oz. Mt. Hood hops
13. will probably bottle on 2015-01-22
