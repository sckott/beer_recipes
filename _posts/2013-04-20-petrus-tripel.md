This was a clone of Petrus Tripel from the book [CloneBrews: Homebrew Recipes for 150 Commercial Beers][book]. 

Recipe:

+ 11.25 lbs Maris Otter 2-row pale malt (I used a replacement malt)
+ 8 oz. Belgian Cara-Vienne malt
+ 4 oz. Belgian aromatic malt
+ 1.5 lbs Belgian clear candi sugar (I used Organic cane sugar instead)
+ 2.5 oz. Styrian Goldings hops (bitterin, flavor) (replacement: Fuggles)
+ 0.5 oz. Williamette hops (aroma)
+ 0.5 oz. sweet orange peel
+ yeast: Wyeast 3787 Trappist High Gravity
+ 0.25 oz. steamed French light toasted oak chips

Got all ingredients from [Dan's Homebrew](http://beermaking.ca/)

Steps:

1. I'm doing whole grain, so I made a mash tun that looks like this

![mashtun](http://sckott.github.io/beer_recipes/assets/img/mashtun.jpg)

Warmed up water in pot on stove to 151 degrees F. Then poured the whole three malts together into the cooler, and poured enough water on top of the malts to cover them.I stirred occasionally and measured temperature. If it was too cold I put in some hot water. 

This is what it looks like while doing its thing in the cooler

After 90 min., vorloft a few times, drain out into pot, and sparge a bit. 

2. Bring volume in pot up to about 5 gallons. Bring to boil. 
3. Add 
	+ 1.5 oz. Syrian goldings hops (for bittering)
	+ 1.5 lbs sugar
4. Boil for 45 min
5. Add
	+ 1 oz. Syrian goldings hops (for flavor)
	+ 0.5 oz. orange peel
	+ 1 tbsp irish moss
6. Boil for 12 minutes
7. Add
	+ 0.25 oz. Williamette hops (for aroma)
	+ 0.5 oz. orange peel
8. Boil for 3 minutes
9. Remove pot from stove and cool down as fast as possible to temperature ideal for the yeast. I have Wyeast 1214 Belgian Abbey, which says to pitch yeast at 65-72 degrees F.
10. Transfer cooled down wort to primary fermenter
11. Put in yeast when temperature is right (pitched at XXX degrees F)
12. Took gravity reading right after pitching yeast. It was at 1.03, and was supposed to be at 1.074. So I boiled about 10 oz DME (all I had) + 11 oz sugar (all I had) in water, let it cool to 70 deg F, then mixed it in to the primary fermenter.

<!-- 12. Primary fermentation started on 2013-04-28, ended 2013-05-XX
13. Secondary fermentation started on 2013-05-XX, ended on 2013-05-XX
14. Final gravity reading before bottling was about 1.005, not very high alcohol that is. -->
